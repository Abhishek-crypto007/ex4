  <h1>🏠 Home</h1>
  <p>
    My home isn’t just a place I live in, it’s a reflection of me. It’s warm, calm, and filled with little details that make it feel alive. Every corner carries a bit of my personality—sometimes it’s cozy and quiet, sometimes it’s full of energy and laughter. It’s the kind of space that welcomes you in and makes you want to stay, a spot where memories are made without even trying. To me, it’s more than four walls—it’s comfort, peace, and my favorite place to just be myself.
    
    
    
    
    
    There's no place like home. Sit back, relax, and feel cozy.</p>
